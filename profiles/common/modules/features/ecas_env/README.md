Installation
------------

The feature needs to be enabled by an administrator, it is not available in feature set.
The path to the library version is defined for all instances as $util_dir . '/phpcas/CAS.php'

*However* that path can be overriden by setting a new value to 'FPFIS_ECAS_PATH' in your settings.php
If no value constant is defined for FPFIS_ECAS_PATH, the library path will fallback to custom modules ecas/libraries subfolder.

Usage
-----

When feature is enabled, a button 'Ecas Login' is available on each page.
The button redirects the user to the ECAS login screen.
After credentials are rightly submitted, a user page is created and user is redirected to that page.
An entry is created in the authmap table:

| aid | uid | authname | module |
|-----|----:|----------|--------|
|   1 |   6 | leperde  | ecas   |

<dl>
<dt>The profile page is pre filled with the following fields in readonly mode.</dt>
  <dd>First name</dd>
  <dd>Last name</dd>
  <dd>E-mail address</dd>
  <dd>Creator</dd>
</dl>

The logout link is replaced with the *ecaslogout* link.

#Local configuration for user_sync
In order to test the user sync feature locally against LDAP production server, 
you need to provide some extra configuration in your settings.php file

- define('FPFIS_LDAP_SERVER_NAME', 'XXXX');
- define('FPFIS_LDAP_SERVER_PORT', 'XXXXX');
- define('FPFIS_LDAP_BASE_DN', 'XXXXX');
- define('FPFIS_LDAP_BASE_DN_DG', 'XXXXX');
- $ldap_password = 'XXXXX';
- $fpfis_ldap_user = 'XXXXXX';
- define('FPFIS_LDAP_USER_DN', sprintf('uid=%s,ou=TrustedApps,o=cec.eu.int', $fpfis_ldap_user));
- define('FPFIS_LDAP_PASSWORD', $ldap_password);

The values can be retrieved from dorstenia server.
