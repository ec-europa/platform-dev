  Business Indicators

The Business Indicators Multisite features provide a set of blocks with figures 
about a Multisite installation's user and content. System administrators will 
be able to place said blocks in specific areas of the site by using the Context 
module, already provided on each Multisite installation. Information can be 
displayed in textual form, by using lists, tables, etc. or by using graphical 
charts.

"Business Indicators", or by visiting "admin/reports/business-indicators".
