## CA Certificate path
The variable "ecas_certificate_path" contains the path of the CA 
certificate of the EU Login server. The Eu login module can then use it in order to validate content sent from the EU 
Login server.

The Eu login module does not need it in order to run but it is nevertheless 
recommended to set it in the settings file of the site.

Both will be included from the FPFIS_COMMON_LIBRARIES_PATH, which has to be
defined, typically in settings.php

This is a php library used for all the php applications of the flexible plateform (FPFIS).
The important data in this library for the EU Login module are :
- EU Login settings (url, port, ...)
- LDAP settings (credentials, base DN, ...)

## Drupal Dependencies :

- ECAS : Provides single sign-on EU Login
Required by:
-- ECAS extra (enabled),
-- ECAS import users (enabled)
- ECAS extras : Provides extra features to the EU Login module
Requires:

## Other modules
### core ECAS module :
This module allows a user to login to a drupal instance with an EU Login account.
During the first login, the module creates a drupal account with the data from 
the LDAP (username, password, email, ...).
With drupal 6 the module was compatible with the modules node_profile, profile 
to store users data in users profiles, nodes and CCK fields.

With drupal 7, the module must populated the following fields related to user 
accounts :

- user-user-field_firstname

- user-user-field_lastname

### ecas_import_users :
This module allows the system to browse the LDAP directory, import users accounts and 
create related users accounts.
Same updates as the core module. This module must populate the following fields 
related to user accounts during a user account creation :

- user-user-field_firstname

- user-user-field_lastname

### ecas_extra :
This module enables moderation of the access to a drupal instance with EU Login 
accounts.
The new users that logged in for the first time with their ecas accounts are 
put in a pending list and must wait for the validation of a moderator. An email is sent when the account is authorized
or rejected.
The module needs the following drupal modules : views, views bulk operation.

### ecas_group_sync :
This module allows mappings between LDAP fields and users accounts settings :

- for the standard multisite : it provides a mapping between users DG and drupal
roles
- for the community multisite : it provides a mapping between DG and og roles in
communities
