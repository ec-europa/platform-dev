ant prepare   # The default action, tags, packages, and commits to the local repository
ant push      # Push the new commits and tags to the origin repository (github)
ant upload    # Upload to jasig
ant makeCurrentSymlink # Set the symbolic link on the jasig site.
The ant prepare target is equivalent to ant tag && ant dist && ant markdev.

To revert the commits and tag additions added in the ant tag and ant markdev
targets, use the new ant revert target. This should not be done after pushing.

Running ant prepare is safe and can be followed by ant revert to get rid of the
added commits and tag in your local repository.
