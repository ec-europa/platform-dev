# This test fails because the node:field-tag is configured to store one value.
# Also it seems that the token 'node:field-tag:parents-uri' don't exist.
Feature: Pathauto
  In order to manage automatic aliases on the website
  As an administrator
  I want to be able to set up patterns for the automatic alias creation.

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role

  Scenario: Using the All parent terms uri token on a node with a term reference field
    Given there is a single tag field in the article content type
    And the term ballsports with the parent term sport in the vocabulary tags exists
    And the term football with the parent term ballsports in the vocabulary tags exists
    And the pathauto "pathauto_node_article_pattern" pattern is set to "[node:field-tag:parents-uri]/[node:field-tag:name]/[node:source:title]"
    Then I go to "node/add/article"
    And I fill in "Title" with "TestArticle"
    And I fill in "Tag" with "football"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should be on "/sport/ballsports/football/testarticle_en"
