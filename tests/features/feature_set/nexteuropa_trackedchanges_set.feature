Feature: Change tracking features
  We check that a user can enable the "NextEuropa Tracked Changes" set, but he can disable it
  only if no tracked changes are detected in the current values of WYSIWYG fields

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role

  Scenario: As administrator, I can enable/disable the "NextEuropa Tracked Changes" feature if tracked changes are not
  detected on fields that use this profile
    When I go to "admin/structure/feature-set"
    And I click "Editorial Management"
    And I click the ".form-item-featureset-nexteuropa-trackedchanges" element
    And I press "Validate"
    And I wait for the end of the batch job
    Then I should see the success message "NextEuropa Tracked Changes feature is now active on your site."
    When I go to "admin/config/content/wysiwyg/tracked_changes/table_status"
    Then the response should contain "Tracked changes logs status"
    When I go to "admin/structure/feature-set"
    And I click "Editorial Management"
    And I click the ".form-item-featureset-nexteuropa-trackedchanges" element
    And I press "Validate"
    And I wait for the end of the batch job
    Then I should see the success message "NextEuropa Tracked Changes feature is now inactive on your site."
    When I go to "admin/config/content/wysiwyg/tracked_changes/table_status"
    Then the response should not contain "Tracked changes logs status"

  Scenario: As administrator, I could not disable the "NextEuropa Tracked Changes" feature if tracked changes are detected
  on fields that use this profile
    When I go to "admin/structure/feature-set"
    And I click "Editorial Management"
    And I click the ".form-item-featureset-nexteuropa-trackedchanges" element
    And I press "Validate"
    And I wait for the end of the batch job
    Then I should see the success message "NextEuropa Tracked Changes feature is now active on your site."
