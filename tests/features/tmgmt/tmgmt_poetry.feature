    Scenario: Inspect the 'Last change' data of a translation request
      Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role
      And I am viewing a multilingual "page" content:
        | language | title            | body                    |
        | en       | Title            | Last change column test |
      When I click "Translate" in the "primary_tabs" region
      Then I should see "Last change"
      When I check the box on the "French" row
      And I press "Request translation"
      And I press "Submit to translator"
      Then I see the date of the last change in the "French" row
