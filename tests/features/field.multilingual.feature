Feature: Field Multilingual features
  In order to easily understand the content of the European Commission
  As a citizen of the European Union
  I want to be able to read field label in my native language


  Background:
    Given the following languages are available:
      | languages |
      | en        |
      | fr        |
      | de        |

  @theme_wip
  # It is in wip because of the steps:
  # - And I should see "My Group Color" in the "nept_element:field-group:color-selection-legend" element
  # - And I should see "Select a Color" in the "nept_element:field:color-selection-label" element
  # - And I should see "Red" in the "nept_element:field:color-selection-value" element
  # The reason is the field component is not implemented yet.
  # It will be done with the ticket NEPT-1066
  Scenario: Administrator can translate field and field group labels. Once it is done,
  users see field and field group labels translated in interface language or in the source language
  if translations are not done
    Given I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role
    # Add and translate field and field Group
    And a field with the following settings is added to the "page" type:
      | Label           | Select a Color  |
      | Name            | select_color    |
      | Type            | list_text       |
      | Cardinality     | 1               |
      | Widget          | options_buttons |
      | Allowed values  | Red::Blue       |
      | Translatable    | TRUE            |
    And a field group with the following settings is added to the "page" type view:
      | Label             | My Group Color     |
      | Group name        | group_select_color |
      | Children          | select_color       |
      | Extra CSS classes | group-group-color  |
      | Weight            | 10                 |
    And I am viewing a multilingual "page" content:
      | language | title             | field_select_color |
      | en       | Title in English  | Red                |
      | fr       | Titre en Français | Red                |
