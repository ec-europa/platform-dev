Feature: Field Multilingual features
  In order to easily understand the content of the European Commission

      | languages |
      | en        |
      | fr        |
      | de        |
	And I am viewing a multilingual "page" content:
      | language | title             |field_selectcolor|
      | en       | Title in English  | Red             |
      | fr       | Titre en Français | Red             |
