Feature: Change tracking features
  In order to ease communications between editors while they manage website
  content, a tracking feature is available with WYSIWYG fields.
  I want to use it while I edit content, and I want to see tracked
  changes while I view content draft.
  Tracked changes must be cleared before content is published or sent for
  translation; otherwise the content publishing is blocked

  Background:
    Given the module is enabled
      | modules                   |
      | nexteuropa_trackedchanges |
    And I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role

  Scenario: Text formats should be available
    When I go to "admin/config/content/formats"
    Then I should see "Full HTML + Change tracking"

  @javascript @maximizedwindow
  Scenario: Checking WYSIWYG enabling and disabling change tracking on given WYSIWYG profile
    When I go to "admin/config/content/wysiwyg/tracked_changes/setup"
    And I click "enable tracked changes buttons" in the "Full HTML" row

    And I select "Full HTML + Change tracking" from "Text format"
    And I click the "Insert internal content" button in the "Body" WYSIWYG editor

    And I wait for AJAX to finish
    When I click "Default" in the "Block Webtools" row
