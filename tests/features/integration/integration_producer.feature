Feature: Integration producer
  In order to share my content with other websites
  As a site administrator
  I can push content published on my website to the central Integration server

  Background:
    Given these modules are enabled
      | modules                |
      | nexteuropa_integration |
      | integration_producer   |
    And the following languages are available:
      | languages |
      | en        |
      | pt-pt     |
    And I am logged in as a user with the 'administrator' role

  Scenario: pt-pt translation will be pushed to the central Integration server as pt
    Given the following Integration Layer node producer is created:
    """
      name: test_news
      bundle: page
      resource: news
      mapping:
        title_field: title
        field_ne_body: body
    """
    When I am viewing a multilingual "page" content:
      | language | title               |
      | en       | Title in English    |
      | pt-pt    | Título em Português |
    And I run drush "integration-export http_mock test_news"
    Then the central Integration server received content in the following languages:
      | language | title               |
      | en       | Title in English    |
      | pt       | Título em Português |

  Scenario: content in main language pt-pt will be pushed to the central Integration server as pt
    Given the following Integration Layer node producer is created:
    """
      name: test_news

    Then the central Integration server received content in the following languages:
      | language | title               |
      | pt       | Título em Português |

  Scenario: producers will produce a valid document for content containing title, body and taxonomy term reference.
    Given "tags" terms:
      | name  |
      | Tag 1 |
      | Tag 2 |
    And "article" content:
      | title           | body           | field_tags   |

    And "article" content:
      | title           | body           |
      | Article title 2 | Article body 2 |
    When the following Integration Layer resource schema is created:
    """

      fields:
        title: Title
        body: Body

      mapping:

    Then the "article" producer builds the following document for the "article" with title "Article title 1":
