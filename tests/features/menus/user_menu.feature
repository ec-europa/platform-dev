  Scenario Outline: Test user menu as administrator
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role and I have the following fields:
    | field_firstname | Myrrine |
    | field_lastname  | Augusta |
    When I am on the homepage
    And I click "<link>"

    # "Page not found" appears after logging out and being redirected to the
    # homepage.
