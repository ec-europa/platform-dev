  As the head of the editorial staff
  I want to define the content staging actions individual staff members can perform

  Scenario: A user with 'contributor' group role cannot publish nodes
    # This is a regression test for a privilege escalation bug. An authenticated
    # user was able to set the moderation state of a newly created node when she
    # was assigned the 'contributor' group role.
    # See https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/CITnet/jira/browse/MULTISITE-5241
