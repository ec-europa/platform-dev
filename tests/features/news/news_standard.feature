Feature: news standard and news core
  In order to publish news
  As different types of users
  I want to be able to propose news

  Background:
    Given the module is enabled
      | modules       |
      | news_core     |
      | news_standard |
    And I am viewing a "news" content:
      | title                          | News test 1      |
      | author                         | admin            |
      | body                           | news test 1 body |
      | field_news_publication_date    | 1510226280       |
      | group_content_access           | 1                |
      | status                         | 1                |
      | workbench_moderation_state     | published        |
      | workbench_moderation_state_new | published        |

  Scenario: as user, I can see news menu link and click on it to see the published news
    Given I am not logged in
    When I am on the homepage
    Then I should see "News"
    When I go to "news"
    Then I should see the heading "News"
    And I should see "News test 1"
    When I click "News test 1"
    Then I should see "news test 1 body"

  Scenario Outline: as a user with permissions I can propose news for publication
    Given I am logged in as a user with the '<role>' role
    When I go to "node/add/news"
    And I fill in "edit-title" with "<title>"
    And I fill in the rich text editor "Body" with "body for the Test News behat"
    Then I should not see "Publication date"
    And I click "Dates"
    And I should see "Publication date"
    And I fill in "edit-field-news-publication-date-und-0-value-datepicker-popup-0" with "06/11/2017"
    And I fill in "edit-field-news-publication-date-und-0-value-timeEntry-popup-1" with "12:00"
    And I press "Save"
    Then I should see the text "News <title> has been created"

      | role          | title                   |
